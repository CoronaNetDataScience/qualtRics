## Release summary

This is the 8th CRAN release of qualtRics (the 2nd since it has returned to CRAN since being archived). This release includes bug fixes, more robust data import, improvements in documentation and error checking, and access to the column mapping for a survey. The function `registerOptions()` has been deprecated to avoid unexpected behavior when certain options are set.
